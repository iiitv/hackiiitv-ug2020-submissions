THEME - E GOVERNANCE
WHAT IT WILL DO?


* ONLINE CERTIFICATE GENERATOR (VIA STATE GOV. & LOCAL COLLECTORATE)
* TAX PAYMENTS (VIA MUNICIPAL CORPORATION APPLICABLE ACC TO LOCATION)
* BILL PAYMENTS (ELECTRICITY, WATER etc.)
* RENEWAL OF LICENSES, CARDS etc.(VIA STATE GOV)
* PUBLIC COMPLAINTS DASHBOARD.




IMP FEATURES OF EACH:
* WHILE APPLYING FOR A CERTIFICATE , THE CHARGES AND ISSUING TIME MUST BE FIXED PRIORLY
* FOR VARIOUS KINDS OF CERTIFICATE GENERATION, USER HAVE TO REGISTER HIMSELF/HERSELF ONLY ONCE WITH ALL THE NECESSARY DETAILS (E - KYC).
* IF IN CASE THE DEADLINE FOR GENERATION EXCEEDS , USER CAN GENERATE AN OPEN COMPLAINT TICKET VISIBLE TO ALL UNDER THE SPECIFIED DEPARTMENT ON THE DASHBOARD.
* THE TAX/BILL PAYMENT REQUIRES THE USER TO CREATE A PROFILE JUST ONCE AND THUS WOULD SAVE TIME.
* REGULAR REMINDERS / NOTIFICATIONS WILL BE SEND TO THE USER REGARDING THE PAYMENTS OR RENEWALS TO AVOID FINE.
* RENEWAL OF LICENSES/CARDS WOULD BE AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS I.E IF THE USER ACCEPTS THE RENEWAL ONCE NOTIFIED , HE/SHE WON'T BE SUBMITTING ALL THE NECESSARY DOCS AGAIN.
* USER COULD ALWAYS GENERATE A COMPLAINT TICKET TO THE SPECIFIED DEPARTMENT AND ITS RESPONSE MUST BE GIVEN IN A FIXED AMOUNT OF TIME.


MOST  IMP POINT - 
ALL THESE  BENEFITS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE USER JUST BY REGISTERING ONCE , I.E GOV. UNDER YOUR FINGERS XD.
