# E-Sahayata

We intend to create a website that digitizes the whole process of issuing government documents and certificates. Along with this, the website will have features that digitize various processes which are usually known to be cumbersome and physical, like the renewal of PAN card, updation of Aadhar card, Ration card and other similar kinds of ordeals!







## Features

* Online Certificate/Document Generator
* Tax/Bill Payments
* Renewal of licenses, cards, etc.
* Public Complain Dashboard
  
## Benefits

E-Sahayata presents to you a one-stop solution for most of the official tasks. Its purpose is to **SATE** the citizens i.e. be **Simple**, **Accessible**, **Transparent** and above all, **Efficient**.    

A single interface will be dealing with online certificate generation along with automatic renewal, all types of taxes/bills payments and a dedicated public complaint dashboard that will help you to raise an issue, which has to be resolved within a given amount of time.  

- **Simplicity & accessibility:** 
    - Users have to create a single profile just once using E-KYC.
    - This single profile would help in generating all kinds of official certificates without printing and applying the same documents again and again, like the Aadhar Card, which is a prerequisite for issuing almost all government documents.
    - Services like AI-assisted facial recognition and video conferencing with officials for document verifications will be available for the ease of access of senior citizens and PWDs.
    - Updation of Ration cards/certificates can now be done from the comfort of your home easily.

- **Transparency:** 
    - The charges and issuing deadline of the certificates would be known to the user before applying for them, thereby leaving no space for any in-between dwellers minting money and living off of gullible citizens’ ignorance.
    - All the registered complaint tickets will be visible to everyone viewing the website, which would promote transparency between the system and the citizens. 
    - The current number of complaints registered will be available on the dashboard under the specified department, encouraging the people in authority to serve the citizens to the best of their ability.
    - The cumulative data of how many issues were raised and how many of them were resolved in a certain period and region will also be made available to the voters for electing the candidates of their constituency based on how much work is done and how efficiently it is done. 

- **Efficiency:**
    - All kinds of government taxes/bills/payments can be paid using this profile; ultimately saving both the citizens’ and government officials’ time, energy and money.
    - Renewal of licenses and cards would be a fully automated process once the user agrees to the renewal i.e. the user will not have to go through the same process again thereby saving their time.
    - Our Public Complaint Dashboard will provide an efficient way to resolve the issues of the users as quickly and efficiently as possible.
