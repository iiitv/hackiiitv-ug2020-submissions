We support Renewable Energy. 
Renewable energy is future 


WHY DO WE NEED NAVIKARAN?
Over the years, we have seen how important renewable energy is but if we will go internet, 
we don’t really find any website which can really help you with finding the amount of equipment 
you will need to make using renewable energy reliable.
Also no other web help is availabe in this context which can help user up to this extend 

With Navikaran you get all that at one place.

67% achievement :
Due to the lack of time, we were only able to make our wind energy and solar energy sections fully function. 

But in few weeks, we will also be able to provide services related to other renewable energy forms like water, biomass and etc.

**In NaviKaran, Our primary aim is to make the general population more familiar with renewable energy and 
provide them best help  from selection to installation journey

Solar energy:

When it comes to India, we have an abundance of solar energy and the fact that we are still not able to use 
it to its full capacity is outraging.

Most of us don’t really realise how easy it is to install a solar panel in their households and 
that is why we came up with this web-site which will help every user to know the advantages, disadvantages 
and cost of a solar panel.

To make it easier to understand, we have also provided a link to a solar panel cost calculator 
which takes all the state-wise subsidies into considerations.

Wind energy:    
Wind energy is very efficient and reliable in a region which is not close to the coast and when 
it comes to India we have many regions which satisfy this condition.
Although wind turbines are very expensive but at the same time they are very efficient and 
in the right conditions they can easily fulfil electricity needs of 1000+ households.
To make it easier for the user to estimate the power production of a turbine we have also add 
a calculator which uses Open-Weather api to know about the climate of the region the user wants to know about. 
With pressure, temperature and wind velocity we can easily estimate the power production of a wind turbine of a given size.
