# Helping Hand

### Description 
A Helping Hand is what we all need in critical times. In an emergency, time and location accuracy are critical and so by downloading our app 'Helping Hand ', one can transmit accurate personal details directly to the control center of the police or call for an ambulance along with informing the trustees of the person concerned. It just takes 3-5 minutes to get registered and all the information is secured on the device itself. All you need to do is set up your profile by providing details like name, gender, email id while registering and then login through the mail with entered  password. On arriving at the homepage you can add or edit contacts for emergency situations. In critical situations, so far, it has hardly been possible for people with health problems to initiate their own rescue and aid measures quickly. Helping Hand offers a solution for this with an easy to access, simply designed homepage. Not only this, whenever you are in dire need, we will provide you with a Helping Hand as you are responsible to yourself, to love yourself, to care for yourself, and to help yourself!

With love, from TEAM Newbies!
