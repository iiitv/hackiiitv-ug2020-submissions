India is a developing country, the majority of its population belong to the rural area, and their primary job is agriculture. But it’s been decades since these rural people are living the same way they used to live 30 years ago. It is because agriculture in India is not a profit-making job anymore.

So as the farmers face many problems in Agriculture every year, we have tried to list out two major problems from it and work on its solution.
Problems:
Labour Shortage
Lack of Modern Technologies
 
Everyone thinks there is ample farm labour available. But the problem is the availability of labour at the right time and at the right cost. At peak times, like sowing, transplanting, harvesting, etc., it is very difficult to get sufficient farm labour. 

One solution to address major problems faced by farmers is greater reliance on technology, be it through farm mechanization, the use of weedicides or genetic engineering, that can lower input and time costs. There are two reasons why farmers are not using modern equipment. First, they are not aware, and second, they can’t afford such equipment. 
Also, Farmers should be encouraged to use such labour-saving options instead of being burdened with the social objective of protecting rural employment and being denied access to new technology. 

# The Problem it solves:

 Regarding recruitment, the farmer will have a knowledge of the possible labour sources in his area and how to avail himself of these sources. 
This will create an awareness to the rural people about the advancement of technology. Once they are familiar with new technology they can easily find a way to earn a daily wage.
Farmers can take advantage of big machinery by renting them only, there will be no need to buy.



# Challenges We ran into:

As people in the rural area are not much familiar with the new technology, first we have to train them properly so they can get benefit from our initiative.
It is difficult to rearrange the parts of damaged machinery in rural areas as there is a lack of service centres and skilled repairmen.
Lack of Transport Systems 






# Important Features:

Farmers can get the status of availability of labour in their area with just a few tap.
