INTRODUCING TO OUR PROJECT :

	Name of our App: KWIK-EZ
	Theme of our App: Smart city and Medical services	
	TechStack Used: Flutter

THE MAIN IDEA OF OUR PROJECT:

	The main intention of our project is to make our daily life work easier and better. For example, you want to visit a mall located nearby your house and it comes to know that the mall is under construction and will remain closed for 2 days. Why does it happen? Do you know? Yes, because of lack of information and that's the idea of our project. Our app provides you with all information like opening/closing time, ticket fare, available services, location, etc of all visiting places around you like mall, bank, hospital, tourist places, etc. Apart from this, you can get services like medical service, online shopping, detailed information of on-going, future or awaited projects of your city and bank services.

As the name suggests KWIK-EZ, our app makes every daily life thing quick and easy it’s users.
From keeping track of one’s medical health to a complete guide of your city, this app brings all the smart features in a single click.
